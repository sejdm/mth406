<li><p>Show that if we allow a Turing machine’s head to stay where it is, i.e. the set of possible directions for the head are <span class="math inline">\(\{L,R,S\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> means “stay”, then any computation that it can perform, can also be performed by an ordinary Turing machine.</p></li>
